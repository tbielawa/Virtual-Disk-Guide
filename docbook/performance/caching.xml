  <title>I/O Caching</title>

  <para>
    I/O caching requirements differ from host to host. I/O caching
    refers to the <firstterm>mode</firstterm> (or <firstterm>write
    policy</firstterm>) by which the kernel writes modified data to
    both the cache and the caches backing store. There are two general
    modes to consider, <firstterm>write-back</firstterm> and
    <firstterm>write-through</firstterm>. Let's review them now:

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Write-back</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Writes are done <firstterm>lazily</firstterm>. That is,
            writes initially happen in cache, and then are propagated
            to the appropriate backing storage device. Also known as
            <firstterm>write-behind</firstterm>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Write-through</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Writes are done synchronously to cache and the backing
            store (main system memory/disk drive).

    Selecting the correct cache mode can increase or decrease your
    overall system performance. Selecting the correct mode depends on
    several factors, including:

  </para>

  <para>
    In addition to write-back and write-through modes there is a third
    pseudo-mode called <firstterm>none</firstterm>. This mode is
    considered a write-back mode. In this mode the onus is on the
    guest operating system to handle the disk write cache correctly in
    order to avoid data corruption on host crashes<footnoteref
    linkend="QEMU-User-Docs-invocation"/>. In a supported system where
    latency/throughput are valued over data integrity you should
    consider choosing the <quote>none</quote>
    mode<footnote><para><link

  </para>

  <remark>TODO: It would be great to explain what systems handle disk
  write cache better than others</remark>

  <para>
    Next we'll review the two cache mode options in greater detail. At
    the end of the chapter we'll summarize the use cases for each
    mode.
