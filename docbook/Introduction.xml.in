      I was motivated to write this book because I felt the quality
      of the information regarding commonly used functionality in
      virtual disk operation was lacking certain specific clear
      examples. The information that is available is not contained
      in a central location. Some concepts of the qemu system aren't
      covered at all. FAQs lead on to having an answer to a
      particular query, but many lead you to off site resources,
      some of which are no longer available on the Internet.
    </para>

    <para>
      What I hope to provide is a book which will demonstrate the
      core concepts of virtual disk management. This book will
      concern itself primarily with the <command>qemu-img</command>
      tool and common GNU/Linux disk utility tools like
      <command>fdisk</command>, <command>parted</command>, and
      <command>resize2fs</command>. Most importantly to me, in the
      case of non-trivial examples, I hope to identify what the
      relevant technical concepts are and how they work up to the
      final result of each example.

    <title>Units &amp; Prefixes</title>

    <para>
      Throughout this book you will see file sizes specified with an
      assortment of units. For example: 42 kB, 42 Mb, 42 GiB, 42 G, 42 GiB.

    <para>
      Without an explanation this may seem confusing, random, and
      inconsistent. However, there is a method to this madness:

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The unit used in discussion preceding/following an example
            is consistent with the convention used in the example
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Without any scope or context, binary prefixes are used
            (e.g., 1024 KiB, 35565 MiB)
          </para>

    <para>
      If you have a suggestion for improving the book, try to be as
      specific as possible when describing it. If you have found an
      error, please include the section number and some of the
      surrounding text so I can find it easily. I also recommend you

      If you're submitting an error with an example, please try and
      include as much relevant information about your setup as
      possible. This includes (but is not limited to): your operating
      system and version, the version of the software the example
      happens with, if you are running the command as the root user or
      not, and the exact commands to run to reproduce the error.
