  <title>Converting Between RAW and QCOW2</title>

    <title>Convert an Image from RAW to QCOW2</title>

    <para>
      RAW images, though simple to work with, carry the disadvantage
      of increased disk usage on the host OS. One option we have is to
      convert the image into the QCOW2 format which uses zlib
      compression and optionally allows for 128 bit AES encryption.

      <remark>TODO: Explain how QCOW2 only uses as much space as there
      is data in the image. Also talk about sparse file
      systems</remark>

      Here's how to do the last example, but in reverse.

    <note>
      <para>
	When converted to the RAW format the image has the potential
	to take up much more disk space than before.
