      <question>
        <para>
          Why are my cloned disks so big, I thought QCOWs would be
          smaller if my disk was mostly empty <emphasis>&#8253;</emphasis>

          <footnote><para>This character <quote>&#8253;</quote> is
          called the <firstterm>interrobang</firstterm>. I just blew
          your mind.</para></footnote>

      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          Creating a disk image from a device copies
          <emphasis>all</emphasis> blocks from the source device. This
          includes data which has been deleted on the filesystem.
        </para>

        <para>
          When you delete a file from the filesystem the operating
          system will not signal to the disk that it should mark the
          formerly occupied blocks as free
          <footnote>
            <para>This is what allows data recovery software to work</para>
          </footnote>
          . The additional overhead associated with the operation
          would hurt disk performance.
        </para>

        <para>
          So what option do you have available if you want to minimize
          the size of the created disk image? You have two options, a
          free utility called <application>zerofree</application>

      <question>
        <para>
	  Why do I get a <computeroutput>device busy</computeroutput>
	  error message when unmounting
	  <replaceable>$THING</replaceable>?
        </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
	  A process is accessing files on the mounted volume. Possible fixes:

	    <para>
	      Sometimes the solution is a simple as
	      <firstterm>lazily</firstterm> unmounting the device. Do
	      this by giving the <option>-l</option> option to
	      <command>umount</command>.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Make sure you don't have any open shells whose present
	      working directory is in the path you're trying to
	      unmount.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      If that doesn't work you can try using the
	      <command>fuser</command> command to find what processes
	      are accessing the device. For example:
	      <computeroutput>fuser
	      /mnt/thumbdrive</computeroutput>. This command also
	      accepts an optional <option>-k</option> option, which
	      will try to kill all processes accessing the busy path.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      If none of that works you can try the
	      <command>lsof</command> command (superuser permissions
	      required to see <emphasis>everything</emphasis> being
	      accessed). For example: <computeroutput>lsof | grep
	      /mnt/path</computeroutput>.
