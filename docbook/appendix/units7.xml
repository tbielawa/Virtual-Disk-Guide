      <title>Binary prefixes</title>
      <para>
	The binary prefixes resemble the decimal ones, but have an
	additional 'i' (and "Ki" starts with a capital 'K').  The names
	are formed by taking the first syllable of the names of the
	decimal prefix with roughly the same size, followed by "bi" for
	"binary".

      <para>
	Before these binary prefixes were introduced, it was fairly
	common to use k=1000 and K=1024, just like b=bit, B=byte.
	Unfortunately, the M is capital already, and cannot be
	capitalized to indicate binary-ness.
      </para>

      <para>
	At first that didn't matter too much, since memory modules and
	disks came in sizes that were powers of two, so everyone knew
	that in such contexts "kilobyte" and "megabyte" meant 1024 and
	1048576 bytes, respectively.  What originally was a sloppy use
	of the prefixes "kilo" and "mega" started to become regarded as
	the "real true meaning" when computers were involved.  But then
	disk technology changed, and disk sizes became arbitrary
	numbers.  After a period of uncertainty all disk manufacturers
	settled on the standard, namely k=1000, M=1000k, G=1000M.
      </para>

      <para>
	The situation was messy: in the 14k4 modems, k=1000; in the
	1.44MB diskettes, M=1024000; etc. In 1998 the IEC approved the
	standard that defines the binary prefixes given above, enabling
	people to be precise and unambiguous.
      </para>

      <para>
	Thus, today, MB = 1000000B and MiB = 1048576B.
      </para>

      <para>
	In the free software world programs are slowly being changed to
	conform. When the Linux kernel boots and says:

	hda: 120064896 sectors (61473 MB) w/2048KiB Cache
      </screen>

      <para>
	the MB are megabytes and the KiB are kibibytes.
