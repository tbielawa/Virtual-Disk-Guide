    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      The best way to learn is by doing, so to learn the concepts of
      virtual disks we're going to create a 1GiB virtual disk from
      scratch. This information is applicable to the topic of disks in
      general, it's value is not limited to virtual disks.
    </para>

    <para>
      What makes virtual disks any different from actual hard drives?
      We'll examine this question by creating a virtual disk from
      scratch.

      What does your operating system think a disk drive is? I have a
      320 GB SATA drive in my computer which is represented in Linux
      as the file <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem>.
      Using <command>file</command>, <command>stat</command> and
      <command>fdisk</command> we'll see what Linux thinks the
      <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem> file is.
    </para>

    <para>
      Lets start out by looking at what a regular drive looks like to
      our operating system. Throughout this document the regular drive
      we'll be comparing our findings against will be a 320G SATA hard
      drive drive that Linux references as <systemitem
      class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem>. The following example
      shows some basic information about the device.

      The term "block" is generally interchangeable with the term
      "sector". The only difference in their meaning is
      contextual. It's common usage to say block when referring to the
      data being referenced and to use sector when speaking about disk
      geometry. Officially the term "data block" was defined by
      <orgname>ANSI ASC X3</orgname> in ANSI X3.221-199xata
      <citetitle>AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives
      (ATA-1)</citetitle> §3.1.3 as:

      Storage units need to be clearly defined. Luckily some very
      smart people already took care of that. The
      <orgname>International Electrotechnical Commission</orgname>
      defined binary prefixes for use in the fields of data processing
      and data transmission. Below are some applied to bytes. See
      <xref linkend="VDG-Appendix-Units"/> for the full prefix
      listing.
