      The best way to learn is by doing, so to learn the concepts of
      virtual disks we're going to create a 1GiB virtual disk from
      scratch. This information is applicable to the topic of disks in
      general, it's value is not limited to virtual disks.
    </para>

    <para>
      What makes virtual disks any different from actual hard drives?
      We'll examine this question by creating a virtual disk from
      scratch.
    </para>

    <para>
      What does your operating system think a disk drive is? I have a
      320 GB SATA drive in my computer which is represented in Linux
      as the file <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem>.
      Using <command>file</command>, <command>stat</command>
      and <command>fdisk</command> we'll see what Linux thinks the
      <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem> file is.
    </para>

    <para>
      Lets start out by looking at what a regular drive looks like to
      our operating system. Throughout this document the regular drive
      we'll be comparing our findings against will be a 320G SATA hard
      drive drive that Linux references as <systemitem
      class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem>. The following example
      shows some basic information about the device.

      The term "block" is generally interchangeable with the term
      "sector". The only difference in their meaning is
      contextual. It's common usage to say block when referring to the
      data being referenced and to use sector when speaking about disk
      geometry. Officially the term "data block" was in <orgname>ANSI
      Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X3</orgname> in ANSI
      X3.221-199xata "AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives (ATA-1)"
      §3.1.3 as: data block. This term describes a data transfer, and
      is typically a single sector [...]."

      Storage units need to be clearly defined. Luckily some people
      much smarter than me already took care of that. The

      defined binary prefixes for use in the fields of data processing

	<title>Background on the <command>dd</command> command</title>

	<para>
	  The Use the <command>dd</command> command to create the file
	  that represents our virtual disk. Other higher level tools
	  like <command>qemu-img</command> exist to do similar things
	  but using <command>dd</command> will give us a deeper
	  insight into what's going on. <command>dd</command> will
	  only be used in the introductory part of this document,
	  later on we will use the <command>qemu-img</command> command
	  almost exclusively.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If we're creating a 1GiB disk that means the file needs to
	  be exactly 2<superscript>30</superscript> bytes in size. By
	  default <command>dd</command> operates in block sized
	  chunks. This means that to create
	  2<superscript>30</superscript> bytes it needs to push a
	  calculable number of these chunks into our target disk
	  file. This number is referred to as the
	  <option>count</option>. To calculate the proper
	  <option>count</option> setting we need only to divide the
	  total number of bytes required by the size of a each block.
	</para>

	<equation xml:id="eq.count">
	  <title>Calculating the Count</title>

	  <mathphrase>
	    count = 2<superscript>30</superscript>

	  1073741824/512 = 2097152 (2,097,152)</mathphrase>

	<para>
	  We need something to fill the file with that has no actual
	  value. On Unix systems the best thing to use is the output
	  from <systemitem class="resource">/dev/zero</systemitem> (a
	  special character device like a keyboard).
	</para>

	<note>
	  <para>
	    <systemitem class="resource">/dev/zero</systemitem>
	    doesn't provide endless "0"s. It actually provides endless
	    <keycode>NUL</keycode> control
	    characters(<keycap>^@</keycap> in the Caret
	    Notation[0]). The <keycode>NUL</keycode> control character
	    has the octal value <keycode>000</keycode>. The actual
	    ASCII zero character <keycap>0</keycap> has the hex value
	    <keycode>060</keycode>.
	  </para>
	</note>

	<para>
	  <keycode>NUL</keycode> being a control character [1] means
	  it's a non-printing character (it doesn't represent a

	  <command>cat</command> like this to print 5
	  <keycode>NUL</keycode> characters in Caret Notation:

Understanding what has changed:

   Using parted is the first step to a better thing. You can also use
   parted on regular disk drives to change the kind of partition table
   on any disk (Generally speaking, partition tables are tied to an
   architecture and operating system).

   The GNU parted utility can create a bunch of different table types:
   "bsd", "dvh", "gpt", "loop", "mac", "msdos", "pc98", or "sun" [2].


Now when we run *file* instead of "data" *file* thinks it is an x86
boot sector. That sounds pretty accurate since we just put a partition
table on it.

*stat* still thinks it's a regular file (as opposed to a block special
device, or a socket, etc...).

*fdisk* was able to find a partition table in that boot sector that
 *file* found.

===============================

Creating partitions on disk1.raw

So now disk1.raw has a partition table, but does that mean we can
create partitions on it now? Lets run fdisk on disk1.raw.

    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ fdisk disk1.raw
    You must set cylinders.
    You can do this from the extra functions menu.

    Command (m for help):

To calculate how many cylinders to specify you could work backwards
from the formula for calculating disk capacity [F1], but the number of
unknowns at this time make it prohibitively difficult for us to work
out.

    Disk Capacity = Total Disks  *  Cylinders * Heads        * Tracks   * Sectors  * Bytes
                                    per disk    per cylinder   per head   per track  per sector

                                                                [F1] Disk Capacity Formula [3]

Instead of using fdisk on disk1.raw directly, we'll create a loop
device and associate disk1.raw with it. From here on we'll be
accessing our virtual drives through loop devices.

===============================

Creating partitions on a loop device.

Why are we doing this? And what is a loop device?

Unfortunately for data1.raw, it will never be anything more than just
a file. The operating just system doesn't have interfaces for block
operations against files. As the kernel creates the block special
device /dev/sda to represent my hard drive the kernel needs to create
a block special device associated with our file. This is called a loop
device(*).

You can think of a loop device, e.g., /dev/loop1, like a
translator. With a loop device inserted between programs and our disk
image we can view and operate on the disk image as if it were a
regular drive.

  Creating a loop device.

Since we'll be working with the kernel to create a device you'll need
super user permissions to create a loop device(**). Give the *losetup*
commands -f option to find an available loop device and associate
disk1.raw with it.


    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo losetup -f disk1.raw
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo losetup -a
    /dev/loop1: [0805]:151552 (/home/tbielawa/images/disk1.raw)

You can run *file*, *stat*, and *fdisk* on disk1.raw to see for
yourself that nothing has changed since we put a filesystem on it with
*parted*.

Lets examine our newly created loop device now.

    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ file /dev/loop0
    /dev/loop0: block special
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ stat /dev/loop0

    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo fdisk -l /dev/loop0

    Disk /dev/loop0: 1073 MB, 1073741824 bytes
    255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 130 cylinders
    Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
    Disk identifier: 0x000e44e8

          Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System

Look back at when I ran these commands against my actual disk drive
(/dev/sda) and you'll see they're quite similar.

*file* detects loop0 as a block special device

*stat* does too now

*fdisk* no longer says we need to set the cylinders.

Our virtual disk is starting to look like a real hard drive now!

To being this section to a conclusion we'll create a partition, format
it with ext3, and then mount it for reading and writing.


   Creating partitions

Open /dev/loop0 (or whatever loop device your disk was mounted to)
with fdisk to create a partition.

    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo fdisk /dev/loop0

    Command (m for help): n

       e   extended

Unlike /dev/sda we can't just create a partition on the first loop0
partition by addressing it as /dev/loop0. This is because the kernel
has no device created to represent this. Instead we'll have to create
another device associated with a specific offset in (loop0/disk1.raw).

    Why do we have to specify an offset? How do we know what offset to
    specifically?

An "offset" just means how far from the beginning of a device
something is. We need to know this because we're going to create a
device mapped to the first partition (Linux does this automatically
for regular disks during the boot process). Partitions don't start on
the first block of a device because filesystem information is stored
there. To specify the offset we just need to know what sector the
partition (loop0p1) starts on. *fdisk* can give us this
information. (Spoiler: 9 times out of 10 the offset for the first
partition will be 512 * 63 = 32,256).

Print the partition table using *fdisk* with the -u option to switch
the printing format to sectors instead of cylinders for units.

    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo fdisk -ul /dev/loop0

    Disk /dev/loop0: 1073 MB, 1073741824 bytes
    255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 130 cylinders, total 2097152 sectors
    Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Disk identifier: 0x000e44e8

          Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
    /dev/loop0p1              63     2088449     1044193+  83  Linux


/dev/loop0p1 is our first partition and from the table above we know
that it starts on sector 63. Since we have to specify offsets in bytes
we multiply 63 by 512 (the default block size) to obtain an offset of
32256 bytes.

    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo losetup -o 32256 -f /dev/loop0
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo losetup -a
    /dev/loop0: [0805]:151552 (/home/tbielawa/images/disk1.raw)
    /dev/loop1: [0005]:5102 (/dev/loop0), offset 32256

Now that we have /dev/loop1 representing partition of our virtual disk
we can create a filesystem on it and finally mount it.

    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/loop1
    mke2fs 1.41.9 (22-Aug-2009)
    Filesystem label=
    OS type: Linux
    Block size=4096 (log=2)
    Fragment size=4096 (log=2)
    65536 inodes, 262136 blocks
    13106 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
    First data block=0

    Superblock backups stored on blocks:
            32768, 98304, 163840, 229376

    Writing inode tables: done
    Creating journal (4096 blocks): done
    Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done

    This filesystem will be automatically checked every 25 mounts or
    180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop1
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ mkdir partition1
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo mount -t ext3 -o loop,offset=32256 disk1.raw partition1/
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ mount | grep partition1
    /dev/loop0 on /home/tbielawa/images/partition1 type ext3 (rw,offset=32256)
    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ df -h partition1/
    Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/loop0           1008M   18M  940M   2% /home/tbielawa/images/partition1


The same procedure applies to any arbitrary partition: obtain the
starting sector, multiply by block size.


You can destroy the loop device (while leaving your file intact) by
giving the -d option to losetup.

    <tbielawa>@(fridge)[~/images]
    $ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop1

* Don't confuse the often misused term "loopback device" with a "loop
  device." In networking a loopback device refers to a virtual
  interface used for routing within a host. "localhost" is the
  standard hostname given to the loopback address 172.0.0.1. See [4]
  for additional information.

** FUSE (Filesystem is Userspace) has a module called Mountlo that
  allows non-root users to make make loop devices. See [5] for the
  download.
