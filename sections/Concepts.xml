    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      The best way to learn is by doing, so to learn the concepts of
      virtual disks we're going to create a 1GiB virtual disk from
      scratch. This information is applicable to the topic of disks in
      general, it's value is not limited to virtual disks.
    </para>

    <para>
      What makes virtual disks any different from actual hard drives?
      We'll examine this question by creating a virtual disk from
      scratch.
    </para>

    <para>
      What does your operating system think a disk drive is? I have a
      320 GB SATA drive in my computer which is represented in Linux
      as the file <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem>.
      Using <command>file</command>, <command>stat</command>
      and <command>fdisk</command> we'll see what Linux thinks the
      <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem> file is.
    </para>

    <para>
      Lets start out by looking at what a regular drive looks like to
      our operating system. Throughout this document the regular drive
      we'll be comparing our findings against will be a 320G SATA hard
      drive drive that Linux references as <systemitem
      class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem>. The following example
      shows some basic information about the device.
    </para>

      The term "block" is generally interchangeable with the term
      "sector". The only difference in their meaning is
      contextual. It's common usage to say block when referring to the
      data being referenced and to use sector when speaking about disk
      geometry. Officially the term "data block" was defined by
      <orgname>ANSI ASC X3</orgname> in ANSI X3.221-199xata "AT
      Attachment Interface for Disk Drives (ATA-1)" §3.1.3 as:
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>

	    single sector [...].

      Storage units need to be clearly defined. Luckily some very
      smart people already took care of that. The
      <orgname>International Electrotechnical Commission</orgname>
      defined binary prefixes for use in the fields of data processing
      and data transmission. Below are some applied to bytes. See

    <section xml:id="VDG-Concepts-Background-On-dd">
      <title>Background on the <command>dd</command> command</title>

      <para>
	We'll use the <command>dd</command> command to create the file
	that represents our virtual disk. Other higher level tools
	like <command>qemu-img</command> exist to do similar things
	but using <command>dd</command> will give us a deeper insight
	into what's going on. <command>dd</command> will only be used
	in the introductory part of this document, later on we will
	use the <command>qemu-img</command> command almost
	exclusively.
      </para>

      <para>
	If we're creating a 1GiB disk that means the file needs to be
	exactly 2<superscript>30</superscript> bytes in size. By
	default <command>dd</command> operates in block sized
	chunks. This means that to create
	2<superscript>30</superscript> bytes it needs to push a
	calculable number of these chunks into our target disk
	file. This number is referred to as the
	<option>count</option>. To calculate the proper
	<option>count</option> setting we need only to divide the
	total number of bytes required by the size of a each block.
      </para>

      <equation xml:id="eq.count">
	<title>Calculating the Count</title>

	<mathphrase>
	  count = 2<superscript>30</superscript>
	  / 2 <superscript>9</superscript> =
	1073741824/512 = 2097152 (2,097,152)</mathphrase>
      </equation>

      <para>
	We need something to fill the file with that has a negligible
	value. On Unix systems the best thing to use is the output
	from <systemitem class="resource">/dev/zero</systemitem> (a
	special character device like a keyboard). We specify
	<systemitem class="resource">/dev/zero</systemitem> as our
	input file to <command>dd</command> by using the
	<option>if</option> option.
      </para>

      <note>
	<para>
	  <systemitem class="resource">/dev/zero</systemitem> doesn't
	  provide endless "0"s. It actually provides endless
	  <keycode>NUL</keycode> control
	  characters(<keycap>^@</keycap> in Caret Notation
	  <footnote><para><link
	  xl:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_notation">Caret
	  Notation</link> on Wikipedia</para></footnote>). The
	  <keycode>NUL</keycode> control character has the octal value
	  <keycode>000</keycode>. The actual ASCII zero character
	  <keycap>0</keycap> has the octal value
	  <keycode>060</keycode>.
	</para>
      </note>

      <para>
	<keycode>NUL</keycode> being a control character
	<footnote><para><link
	xl:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_code">Control
	Characters</link> on Wikipedia</para></footnote> means it's a
	non-printing character (it doesn't represent a written
	symbol), so if you want to identify it you can use
	<command>cat</command> like this to print 5
	<keycode>NUL</keycode> characters in Caret Notation:

	<title>Formatting Partitions</title>


	<para>
	  Unlike <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem> we
	  can't just create a partition on the first <systemitem
	  class="resource">loop0</systemitem> partition by addressing
	  it as <systemitem
	  class="resource">/dev/loop0</systemitem>. This is because
	  the kernel has no device created to represent this. Instead
	  we'll have to create another device associated with a
	  specific offset in our device/file.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Why do we have to specify an offset? How do we know what
	  offset to specifically?
	</para>

	<para>
	  An "offset" just means how far from the beginning of a
	  device something is. We need to know this because we're
	  going to create a device mapped to the first partition
	  (Linux does this automatically for regular disks during the
	  boot process). Partitions don't start on the first block of
	  a device because filesystem information is stored there. To
	  specify the offset we just need to know what sector the
	  partition (<systemitem
	  class="resource">loop0p1</systemitem>) starts
	  on. <command>fdisk</command> can give us this
	  information. (Spoiler: 9 times out of 10 the offset for the
	  first partition will be 512 * 63 = 32256).
	</para>

	<para>
	  Print the partition table using <command>fdisk</command>
	  with the <option>-u</option> option to switch the printing
	  format to sectors instead of cylinders for units.

	  <systemitem class="resource">/dev/loop0p1</systemitem> is
