      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>
	I was motivated to write this document because I felt the
	quality of the information regarding commonly used
	functionality in virtual disk operation was lacking certain
	specific clear examples. The information that is available is
	not contained in a central location. Some concepts of the qemu
	system aren't covered at all. FAQs lead on to having an answer
	to a particular query, but many lead you to off site
	resources, some of which are no longer available on the
	Internet.
      </para>

      <para>
	What I hope to do is provide a document which will demonstrate
	the core concepts of virtual disk management. This document
	will concern itself primarily with the
	<command>qemu-img</command> tool and common GNU/Linux disk
	utility tools like <command>fdisk</command>. Most importantly
	to me, in the case of non-trivial examples, I hope to identify
	what the relevant technical concepts are how they work up to
	the final result of each example.
